# TimeSeries-VAE-Anomaly-Detection
Sample code for anomaly detection using autoencoder neural networks (LSTM auto-encoder and LSTM VAE) on time series data.

Covered in this repository:
- Sample code for LSTM autoencoder on time series data (both fixed-size and variable-length input)
- Sample code for LSTM variational autoencoder (VAE) on time series data (both fixed-size and variable-length input)
- Sample data (randomly generated sequences that can be easily be supstidued with data set of choice.)
